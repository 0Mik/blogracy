==== Blogracy ====

=== Introduction ===

Blogracy is a simple peer-to-peer social networking system, built on top of Bittorrent.

=== Install ===

The installation process is not yet streamlined. Essentially Blogracy runs as a Vuze
plugin. In order to make it easier to try the project, we distribute the unmodified
Vuze jars in the lib directory. Vuze also needs SWT and some native libraries (on
OS X and Windows at least). Right now, in the libs there are the binary libs for OS X.
It should suffice to add those for windows (see Vuze and Eclipse/SWT docs).

To run Vuze in an IDE, simply create a new configuration which adds the Vuze libs in the
classpath.

Vuze main class to run is: org.gudy.azureus2.ui.swt.Main
Options to be passed to the JVM are:

-d32 -Dazureus.config.path=config  -Djava.library.path="lib/dll"  -Xmx128m -XstartOnFirstThread


-d32 and -XstartOnFirstThread are for OS X only and are needed (the first one only if
you are using a 32bit version of SWT and binary libraries, like those we are using).

We assume that the working directory for the application is the root directory of Blogracy
(the one with .gitignore and this file). So lib/dll is just the right directory (place in 
that one the windows dll which you may need -- not the jars). 

Config is a directory where Vuze will save all its files and configurations. In order for
Vuze to find the new plugin, it is needed that the output files of the compilation go into
the plugins subdirectory of the config directory.

It is not necessary to create a jar file, the classfiles suffice. However, the plugin.properties
file must be there. Essentially the config directory must be something like

+- config
   +- plugins
      +- userRss
         - plugin.properties
         - it/unipr/aotlab/userRss/*.class
